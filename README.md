# code-quiz-week-4-challenge
For this challenge I had to create a javascript quiz. For this project I created several divs to show the different sections of the game. all of them will be cleared by the clearScreen function which will clear the screen to set up for the next section. I also set up a time element to hold the time of the game. I created an isGameOn to tell if the game is running, time and score to hold the current time and score of the player and a scoreArr to hold the highscores. The highscoreLink function will see if the player is in a game if they are it will give the player a chance to save the score that they have scored at that time, if they are not in a game it will take them straight to the high score. The first function that displays content on the screen is the startpage function which shows the header a very brief introduction and a button to start the game. The link to the high score page takes you to the high scores. An important thing is it loads previous high scores from local storage from the start page. The next function is the startGame function that sets up each question and answers. the isGameOn is set to true to set the highscore link to allow the player to save their score as mentioned before. the questionNum to track which question the game is on. there is also the buttonElArr that creates an array of buttons for the answers. The score variable stores how many questions the player gets right. The last variable is to store the questions themselves. The questions consist of a question, an array of answers, the position of the correct answer within the array, and whether or not the question has been asked within the instance of that game. Next the function clears the screen then adds the mainDivEl for the game. it then clears an html from the previous game. Next is the displayNext() function which will display the question and then go through a loop to create buttons for each answer then it will compare its place in the array to the correct position given in the question.it will set that question as answered and then continue to the next question. If all questions are answered it will set the time to -1 and end the game. The last part of the function adds the timer to the game. Once the timer is done it will clear the question and all of the buttons. and resets the time and calls the highscoreInput. The highscoreInput clears the screen, turns the isGameOn to false to allow the player to see the high score without saving there score, and then adds the form for the score input. the screen will show the score of the player and the button to submit the score. Once the button is pressed the submitHighScore function takes over. it gets the value of the name input and creates an array for the individual score. If the name is blank it will ask for the name to be inputed else it pushes the score info into the scoreInfo array then it will push that array in the bigger scoreArr with the rest of the previous score then it will shorten the score so that the highest is on top. Then it will set the local storage from the score array. then it will finally show the high scores. The highscore function first clears the screen then adds the highscoreEl and enters a loop to go through the scores and adds each score from their position. it then adds all of the scores added. finally it adds the restart game function and the clear score function. The clear button clears all of the scores and the restart button restarts the game. finally we have the function that starts the whole process which is the start page();

## Lessons Learned

This challenge was fairly challenging. It gave me knowledge of what the DOM was and how to use it to apply html to a webpage. The challenge reinforced the use of arrays and how to use loops with arrays to create functions with less code, a feature I wish I would have used in the last challenge. I also struggled with how to go through the questions one at a time and was given help about how to look at this question and that's when I figured out that I needed to give each question their own boolean called isAwsered to see if it was asked and answered. It has the same logic as a loop but won't just go through automatically to the last one. Another action I struggled through was how to sort the highscores that are stored. I had found the short technique online which helped a lot with this program which I would store to my local storage afterward.
